## What Jiasheng Wang found interesting

Marc Andreessen stressed in his article in Wall Street Journal that software is revolutionizing multiple industries with key technology including cloud computing, IoT, and APIs. The emerging and advancing software in the following decade has reshaped many digital platform, causing great influence on many fields, including **Information Systems** (IS). However, despite that IS scholars have extensively researched the influence of these technologies, they've overlooked the crucial subject of the software development enabling these innovations. This special issue focuses on the "Orchestration in Contemporary Software Development Ecosystems", emphasizing the evolution and significance of software development's orchestration in today's era. Marc wants to sparkle this scholarly discussion using this issue, emphasizing its relevance and suggesting future research directions in software development orchestration.
