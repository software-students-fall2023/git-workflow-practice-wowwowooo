[The evolution of software development orchestration: current state and an agenda for future research](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0960085X.2020.1831834)

## What I found interesting

This article investigates the historical development and current landscape of software development orchestration practices and tools. It outlines the challenges and opportunities in this domain and presents a research agenda to guide future investigations in order to enhance software development orchestration processes.

## What Jiasheng Wang found interesting

Marc Andreessen stressed in his article in Wall Street Journal that software is revolutionizing multiple industries with key technology including cloud computing, IoT, and APIs. The emerging and advancing software in the following decade has reshaped many digital platform, causing great influence on many fields, including **Information Systems** (IS). However, despite that IS scholars have extensively researched the influence of these technologies, they've overlooked the crucial subject of the software development enabling these innovations. This special issue focuses on the "Orchestration in Contemporary Software Development Ecosystems", emphasizing the evolution and significance of software development's orchestration in today's era. Marc wants to sparkle this scholarly discussion using this issue, emphasizing its relevance and suggesting future research directions in software development orchestration.

## What Ethan Sha found interesting

What caught my attention in this article is the focus on the "orchestration" aspect of software development, which is often overlooked in favor of more straightforward discussions about coding, algorithms, or system architecture. Orchestrating the various elements of a software development project—be it human resources, code repositories, deployment pipelines, or even the customer feedback loop—is a complex but crucial part of successful software development. The article's emphasis on setting a research agenda for better understanding this orchestration suggests that the field is ripe for new methods, tools, and best practices.

I was also intrigued by how the article bridges the gap between academia and industry. While academic research often delves into theoretical and foundational issues, this work recognizes the immediate, practical needs of the ever-evolving software industry. By acknowledging the revolution brought about by cloud computing, IoT, and APIs, the article aligns itself with real-world challenges that developers and project managers face daily.
