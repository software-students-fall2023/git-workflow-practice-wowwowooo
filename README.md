## What Jiasheng Wang found interesting

Marc Andreessen highlighted how software is transforming industries in a Wall Street Journal piece. Despite the emphasis on the impact of these software-powered innovations, the actual software development process has been relatively overlooked by Information Systems (IS) scholars. This special issue looks at how software development has changed over time, focusing on modern methods and tools like DevOps and GitHub. The aim is to spark more discussion on this topic among IS experts.
